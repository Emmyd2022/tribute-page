                    <strong> Goodluck Jonathan</strong><small>
                        , is a Nigerian politician who
                        became the President of Nigeria in 2010 and has been serving in this position til 2015. Prior to
                        assuming the office of the president he had served as the Vice-President of Nigeria and Governor
                        of
                        Bayelsa State. Jonathan has played a very important role in Nigerian politics ever since he
                        became
                        involved with the emerging Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) in the late 1990s. His rise to the
                        top in
                        Nigerian politics is very remarkable given that he was born into a humble family of canoe makers
                        with no background in politics. He holds a doctorate in zoology and has served as an assistant
                        director at the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission. It was only in the late
                        1990s
                        that he joined politics and within years established himself as one of the most prominent
                        politicians in his country. He was made Vice-President of Nigeria after having served as the
                        Governor of Bayelsa State. In this position he maintained a low-profile even as he played a
                        significant role in negotiating with militants in the Niger delta. He served as the Acting
                        President
                        when the incumbent President Yar'Adua took a leave of absence because of illness and succeeded
                        him
                        as the President of Nigeria upon his death.
